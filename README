Input system for 2d fighting games created by Joshua Wong.
This system is intended to listen for and read special moves (inputed as codes)
in games such as street fighter. 

!!! Pygame is needed to run this program


NOTE!!!:
    This system uses the fighting game notation for directional key inputs where
        left = 4
        right = 6
        up = 8
        down = 2
        left-up = 7
        left down = 1
        right up = 9
        right down = 3

    Features:
        Time frames:
            inputs must be inputed within a certain time frame (~ 4 seconds) or the special moves
            will not excecute

        Leniency:
            slightly incorrect input codes will still work as long as the core
            parts of the code are present.

        Double read Protection:
            If a special move is succesful, the inputs used will not be read again

        Priority of moves:
            If multiple codes are read, ONLY the most important special move is excecuted.
            Order of priority:
                Super > Dragon Punch > Fireball > Recency


    How to use:
        Run main.py and input special moves using the number pad and "a" key while the pygame "input System" window
        is selected. The special move outputs will be seen in the terminal [not the pygame window].

        Special moves:

            236a or 214a = Fireball
            6323a or 4121a = Dragon Punch
            236236a or 214214a = Super
